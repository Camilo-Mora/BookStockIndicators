For extended details, visit investopedia. Any given company can chose to become publicly traded by creating an IPO. Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance. Public share issuance allows a company to raise capital from public investors. In turn, any person can buy and sell the given stocks. Once public, a company can be traded (buy or sell its stocks) in a stock exchange or stock market, which is a physical or digital place where investors can buy and sell stock. The price of each share of the given company is driven by supply (how many stocks are available for sale) and demand (how many stocks people want to buy). Lets review that again: the price of a stock is determined by the supply and demand. If the supply of an stock is high (that means there is an over-offer of stocks), the price would expect to go down. If the demand of an stock is high (that means there is short-supply of stocks), the price would expect to go up. "],["what-affects-the-price-of-a-stock.html", "what affects the price of a stock?", " what affects the price of a stock? The price of an stocks can vary for several reasons and at different time scales: Scale of months or years At scales of years, aside from how good or bad a company is, there is a general trend for stocks to move at the speed of the economy. Robust companies should expect to grow at least to the same speed of economic grow of a country. If a country grows at 2% per year, it is expected that stocks of robust companies will grow to at least the same rate. The reason for this relationship is that the central bank regulates interests rates as to ensure an optimun growth. If the economy is tanking, the bank/federal reserve reduces interest rates (meaning people can loan money from banks at lower interest). That allows company to invest, and grow. If the economy is growing too fast, the federal reserve increases interests rates. There is an optimum balance here, as increasing or decreasing interest affects inflation, or buying less for the same amount of money (things become more expensive). The image below show the stock price of Apple over 5 years. Note how this robust company has positive growth, generally reflecting the overall growth of the economy. Figure 1.1: Apple long term grow Short term Dramatic changes in the price of an stock can happen from day to nigh, or rather from one minute to the next, depending on given developments of the company. Here is why it is important to keep up with the news. As an example, in June 21 2021, the Chinese government once again made headlines by claiming that no one in China can trade with Bitcoin. As a result, the price of Bitcoin drop from $31,298 at 1:59 am to $29,470 by 2:44 am. Figure 1.2: Bitcoin crash Elon Musk is another classic example, in which simple Twitt can affect considerably the price of stocks. Other factors that can cause dramatic changes in stock price from one moment to the next one include: Expected reports of economic performance of the given company, purchase of new machines, granting of new patents, lawsuits, changes in CEOs, selling of the company, the climate, terrorist attacks,etc. Below is an example of variations in Bitcoin prices associated with major news Figure 1.3: Bitcoin crash Intra-day variation Over the lapse of a day thousands of people trading look at charts of stocks going up and down in price. The observation of those chart make these people buy or sell the stocks depending if they see a chance to gain, or an opportunity to avoid losing, money. Imagine you see a stock going up in price, while available shares (so call volume) increase. This probably indicates strong momentum, lots of interest, signaling an opportunity to get on the wave and buy, hoping to sell at a higher price. Volume is refered as the number of stocks/shares traded (sold or bought) at a given time intervals. However, as the price starts to go up, some people may start to capitalize by selling their stocks, and this may slow down the price later on. It follows that many traders may get scared that there would be a downturn, forcing them to sell, causing the price to go down. Figure 1.4: Bitcoin crash As noted, the change of the stock price over this small scales, can be influenced by very predictable human behavior. "],["how-to-improve-the-odds.html", "How to improve the odds", " How to improve the odds If one could collect data on all factors that influence the supply and demand of a stock, one could almost certainly predict the price of that stock. The reality is that such data is difficult to gather. Just image if one can predict the next time Elon Musk will twitt? Because of the inability to collect all data that affects supply and demand, stocks may appear unpredictable, or in the eyes of many a gamble. However, shorter fluctuations in stocks price and volume can at times provide signals, likely reflecting euphoric departures from the true value of a stock, which can be predicted providing an edge. The idea here is that changes in stock price and volume can lead to predictable human behavior. Here I provide a compilation of indicators used to improve the odds over short term periods: the human behaviors side of stock prices variations. "],["interpreting-price-movements.html", "Interpreting price movements", " Interpreting price movements As indicated earlier, in this book we are interested in short term trading. At that scale, a lot of predictable human behavior is at play. Think of it as a game with two teams: The Longers and the Shorters. They want different things: Longers, people that buy and want the stock to go up. Shorters, people that sells the stock and want the stock to go down. They fight a never ending war with many battles. At times, you see the longers wining by seeing the price increase, but energy may run low, and the shorters may attack, causing a reversal in price. By affecting the demand and supply of shares, the balance of forces between the longers and the shorters determines the price of the stock. Figure 1.5: Shorters, longers and stock price As a day trading plays out, the transactions by longers and shorters will make the price to go up or down, until a point in which one side sees no gain, and the other wins, causing a breakthrough in the stock price. When you read into stock charts, you need to think on the motivation behind the people driving the patterns. At times, you can see patterns with no return, or very winnable patterns, you can win in.

Like you can buy Coke in Walmart or 7/11, but may be not in Homedepot. This is important because at times the same stock can have different prices in different exchanges. You can actually at times make money by just buying in one exchange and selling in another. There are all pretty fine tune, toug. There are stock exchanges in almost every country, the most famous is the NYSE or the New York Stock Exchange. They operate from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm. Figure 2.1: Bitcoin crash Other stock exchanges are fully electronic like the NASQAT. The Nasdaq is the largest and oldest electronic stock market in the world, meaning all of its buying and selling happens electronically, rather than on a physical trading floor. With the availability of digital trading, some stocks can be traded after hour: The after-hours market trades are from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The pre-market are from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. These are times in New York. "],["long-sale.html", "Long sale", " Long sale Long sale or buying the market means to buy shares of a stock and then sell them.

So if you want to buy an stock, you can only buy at price the sellers are willing to sell (You buy at the Ask price). If you want to sell a stock, you can only sell it at the price buyers are willing to buy, or so call bid price. The price difference between the Ask and Bid price is called The spread "],["the-order-book.html", "The order book", " The order book When you place an order, it goes into what is call an Order book, this is a database maintained by the stock exchange listing all the people that have asked to buy or sell a given stock. It includes the number of shares and their Ask or Bid prices. This book is important because it tells you, if there are shares to be traded at the price that you want. It also sets the priority of who gets the given trades. Say you want to sell 10 shares at $10, and you place your order after another person (lets call it person 2) placed a similar order (10 shares at $10). A different person now wants to buy 5 shares at $10. In this case the stock exchange will sell the shares from person 2. That person has priority over you, as it placed the order earlier. If another person want to buy 10 shares at $10, the exchange will sell the 5 shares remaining from person 2 and five shares of yours. As you can image the Order book is very dynamic, and play a key role on the speed at which shares are traded. Figure 2.5: Order book Commonly the full order book is called data Level 2 and it cost some money to see it in full. Most commonly, you will see what is called the top of the book: only the best ask or bid orders in the book. In the TWS that information is on the left hand sidesee arrow in image below.

"],["limit-orders.html", "Limit orders", " Limit orders In the limit order, you tell the broker to buy or sell shares in a stock at prices equal or better than what you set as the limit price.

In this case you will get whatever Ask or Bid price is there available when the order is triggered. This type of order is filled right away. They prioritize timing but not price. "],["stop-limit-orders.html", "Stop-Limit orders", " Stop-Limit orders In stocks where there is large volatility or not much liquidity (not enough shares traded), there is always a risk of what is call slippage, basically the price can increase or decline rapidly. Under these conditions, if you enter a market order (trade at best available price) you may risk for the order to be traded at very different prices than you expected. The Stop-Limit orders are used as protection against this situations. The stop-Limit is identical to the stop order, but rather than triggering a market order (selling at whichever price is available), it triggers a limit order (filling at or better price that you set as limit). Lets consider the example below, in which you think the price is in a bull trend. So you want to buy low with the expectation to sell high later. However, if by any random chance the price slips upwards, you may ended up purchasing at too high of a price. To protect against this, you can set a buy stop-limit order. Buy only when prices reach the stop price but below the limit price. Figure 2.9: Buy Stop Limit order Below is an example in the opposite case for selling with stop-limit orders. Figure 2.10: Sell Stop Limit "],["timeframe-for-limit-order.html", "Timeframe for limit order", " Timeframe for limit order While using a limit order, the broker has to wait for the stock to reach the price you demanded. That amount of waiting time can be set when placing the limit order in different ways: Day: this means the order will expire at the end of trading day. GTC: Good-Til-Cancelled, the order will be valid until you choose to cancel it. Allow pre-open: It means the order can be also filled from 4:00 am until 9:30, when the open. Fill outside RTH: The order can be filled outside of regular trading hours: orders could be filled in either the morning or evening pre-trading sessions. GTD: (Good-til-Date/Time), It means you can select the time and date until you want the broker trying to make the trade. OPG: that allows your order to be executed as close to the opening price as possible. The order will be accepted if it is received before 9:15AM (ET). These different options are available when placing the order: Figure 2.11: Timing of limit orders In summary, the Stops and Limits are conditions that can be used alone or combined in an order, to better control the entry or exit prices of a trade. "],["stop-loss.html", "Stop loss", " Stop loss When you buy a stock, your expectation is that the stock price will go up. But, there is a risk that the price goes down; as protection against this scenario you use what is call an Stop loss. Basically, at the time that you buy an stock, you put a condition to resell the shares if the price hits a lower stop price. This reselling price, or stop loss, is how much you are willing to risk in a trade if things do no go the way you think. Figure 2.12: Stop loss Stop losses are also be used when shorting a stock. In this case, you would put an stop loss at a higher price that you bought it at. In the case of shorting, your risk is for the stock to go high in price. Figure 2.13: Stop loss "],["trailing-stop.html", "Trailing stop", " Trailing stop A trailing stop (TS) is a stop loss that moves up if price move up, but remains the same if price moves down. This dynamic stop loss offers the safety of preventing major losses if price goes down, while securing gains in the case the price moves up. Image you own shares of a stock at $100 and deploy a TS of 1%. The stock trades lower, and if the price goes below $99 a marker order will be triggered. However, if the price moves to $102, the stop loss will move to ~$101. At this moment, you will already secure $1 profit per share. Stop losses and TSs should be deployed with care because at times quick oscillation of price can trigger them. For instance, one should consider monitoring a TS after a certain profit has been reached, rather than risking for the market going down, the TS should be set higher to secure a larger profit, while still leaving available the option for price to go up. Figure 2.14: Trailing stop You may also chose to use TS to buy shares, buying them at the lowest possible price. Say you are expecting price should at a near time pullback from a downward trend, by placing a buy trialing stop, you will buy after the price moves up above the TS.

However, when placing an order, you could make your mind in advance about how much you want to gain from the trade if the price has gone high enough for your liking. This selling price is call a profit taker. Figure 2.15: Profit taker When shorting, you will place a high profit taker to buy at a lower price. "],["risk-to-profit.html", "Risk to profit", " Risk to profit Any time you make a trade, you are expecting a given trend in the stock price that will turn you a profit. However, there is also risk that the trend goes in the other direction, in which case you will loose money in the given trade. It is generally recommended that you never risk to lose more than 1% of all your capital in a trade. Lets use an example, and say you have $1000 in your brokerage account. So for every trade, you should not risk to loose more than $10. Now lets say, you want to buy 100 shares of a given stock at $10. In this case, you place your order for 100 shares at $10 and place a stop loss at $9.9. Basically, if the price goes below 9.9, you would loose 10cents on each share * 100 shares=$10. Not to be greedy, you could place a Profit taker at $10.2. So, you could take at least $20 cents in profit in this trade. For this given trade, your risk to profit is 1:2. You risk to loose 10 cents but could gain 20. On 100 shares a gain of 20 cents is $20 dollars, for a temporary investment of $1000, and a risk of $10.

The maximum and minimum are shown as a vertical line, also called a shadow. The open and close are shown as boxes, also called body.

That lower threshold is called a support. That is the price supporting the given stock. At times, you will see the price never going beyond a certain price. That given threshold is called a resistance. The price resist to go above that price. Figure 2.20: Resistance and support It is common that when a there is a breakthrough a resistance, the resistance then becomes the support. There are numerous reasons for why the supports and resistance prices occur. A support could emerge, for instance, at prices at which many buyers want to buy (e.g., they may think that stock is cheap at that price), at this given price demand is higher than the supply, and this tends to increase price above the certain value. That price creates a support. The opposite could be said about resistances, which could be seeing at prices at which supply becomes larger demand; the price cannot rise above that level because high supply by sellers wanting to close positions at that price to take profits or opening short position around that particular price. At resistance levels, the supply of stock from sellers is larger than there is demand from buyers, as a result price tends to move below that price. The price resists to move above that resistance price. At times, support and resistance prices can also be set by the amount of shares that were bought or shorted at the given price. An indicator called Volume profiles display the prices at which shares have been most commonly bought. Support or resistance values can also occur at round numbers. Something above the price going above or below a round number makes people tickle. "],["swings.html", "Swings", " Swings Swings are abrupt oscillations in the price of an stock.

Another worse case scenario is when you own many shares of a stock with low liquidity, nobody may want to buy from you.

When price continues an upward trend; good long entry. when price reverses downward from an upward trend; good short entry. when price continues a downward trend; good short entry; when price is consolidated and breaks up; good long entry.

Here I will explain the Trader Workstation TWS, which is the API from the Interactive Brokers. Just Google TWS from Interactive brokers to find how to download it. Upon registering, and logging into the TWS, you will see an screen looking like this image below. The upper left window is the space to place orders (Yellow box) Figure 3.1: TWS Zoom in that box, you have the different options needed to place an order: Figure 3.2: Profit taker Select the stock name you want to trade. If not options are available, simply type the name of the stock. Choose the Smart option, which allows TWS to make your transaction in any stock exchange possible by the given stock. Select whether to buy or sell. Enter number of shares. Select between market or limit order, (there are other types of orders, with added benefits) If a limit order is selected, enter the price you want. Note how above, you can see the current Bid and Ask price. Look at those numbers to get a sense of how far off you are. If the Ask price (price at which people want to sell) is say $10, but you place a limit order to buy at $9, then this order may take a while to fill, may be never, if the price does not go that high. Basically, you want to buy at $9, but the cheapest stock available (Ask price) is $10. In other words, no one wants to sell you at the price you bid. This consideration is important when placing a price for the limit order, as this determines the time it takes for trades to fulfill. It means you could also loose time in specific trades. If you want to buy stock with a limit order, it is recommended to buy a few cents above asking price, as to ensure you will get it. If you want to short an stock, to ensure filling of the order the price should be a few cents below bid price, as to ensure there will be enough buyers willing to buy at the price you want to sell. These extra centes to the trade should be considered when planing the strategy. To ensure trades are quickly filled, When buying shares, price should be at or a bit above Ask price. When shorting, price should be at or a bit below Bid price. Select the time choices for the trade Add the stop loss and profit taker. Submit. After that, you will see a window describing the trade, and commission price. After you accept, the order is placed.

Lets review them. "],["channels.html", "Channels", " Channels Upward Channels The observation here is that the swing highs and lows are successively larger. Think of it as the peak of the competition between Longers and Shorters. Longers buy stock to increase the price causing higher swigns. In response, shorters sell stock to reduce price causing the low swings. When the price goes above the line of the swing highs (upper blue lines in image below), the shorters know they lost and would have to buy the stock back to avoid losing money. This will result in many people trying to buy, which will push the price up. Figure 4.1: Channel If the price of a stock moves below the line defined by the lower swigns (lower black line in image below), then the longers know they lost and would have to sell their shares to avoid loosing money from a falling price. The excess of shares will cause the price of the stock to go down even more. Figure 4.2: Channel downtrend Downward Channels Channels can also occur in declining trends. Here shorters try to bring the price down by selling shares, and in response longers buy stock to increase the price. If the price of a stock moves above the line of the swign highs (upper blue line in image below), the shorters know they lost, and would have to buy stock to avoid losing more money. The excess of people buying will cuase the price to go up. Figure 4.3: Channel downtrend If the price of the stock breaks below the lower line of the channel, then there is a risk for the price to break lower. The shorters won. Figure 4.4: Channel downtrend "],["multi-tops-or-bottoms.html", "Multi Tops or Bottoms", " Multi Tops or Bottoms Double Tops In this pattern, there is an increasing trend in price followed by two similar resistance values, and a swing low in the middle. If after the second swing high, the price drops below the low in the middle, it is expected that the price will go down. So what is happening behind this pattern? The longers keep buying stock causing an increasing trend in price. Once the price gets very high, shorters see an opportunity as a fall from that high of a price there could be a major gain, so they sell stock causing the first downturn in the stock. Longers fight back and buy again with the expectation that the price will continue to go up; this causes the swing low in the middle. Shorters fight back and sell stock causing the second high swing. If the price declines below the low swing in the middle, longers panic, and will start to sell bringing the price down. Figure 4.5: Double Top Double bottoms The same pattern and underlying mechanism can also happens in reverse and it is called a double bottom, instead. Figure 4.6: Double bottoms Triple bottoms The pattern of double bottoms can be seen over three bottoms. Basically, the same approach of the double bottom with basically one more attempt from the opposite site to keep their ongoing trend Figure 4.7: Tripple bottoms Triple tops Going back to the analogy of a war between longers and shorters, a triple tops is a war fought over three battles. If after the third high swing the price of the stock drops below the line of the lows, then the shorters win. Longers panic and in standpipe sell their shares to avoid loses, triggering a major decline in price. Figure 4.8: Tripple bottoms Rectangles At times, you will see the price of a stock bouncing up and down between a clear support and a resistance. This is basically like a pit in which shorters and longers are fighting equally. The equal fight back and forward is visible in the similar high and low swigns. Eventually, the price moves beyond the boundary limits, indicating who won this battle. In this example, the longers win. The shorters are forced to buy stock to avoid losing money on their shorts. This makes the price go up. Figure 4.9: Rectangle In the next example, there is an intense battle, eventually the price slips under the lower boundary, giving the victory to the shorters. In this example, the falling price, forces the longers to sell their stocks to avoid losing money on a falling price. The increasing availability of shares makes the price to go down. Figure 4.10: Rectangle "],["head-and-shoulders-pattern.html", "Head and shoulders pattern", " Head and shoulders pattern This pattern is an extension of the the triple tops patterns, with the exception that the second peak is larger, reflecting a stronger push back of the longers to keep the trend going up. By the third peak, if it is lower than the peak prior, it is enough info for the longers to know they lost the war. They start to sell causing a breakdown price. The fact that the second peak is higher that the two peak on each side creates a pattern resembling a head, with the two side peaks resembling the shoulders, there the name of the pattern. Figure 4.11: Head and shoulders Here is another example: Figure 4.12: Head and shoulders This same pattern above can happens in the opposite direction and it is called a reverse head and shoulders. Figure 4.13: Reverse head and shoulders "],["triangles.html", "Triangles", " Triangles Ascending triangle Here the observation is that there is a hard resistance to the price (Sequential swing highs do not pass that limit). This causes a hard horizontal line in the upper price of the stock. Concurrently, the swing lows keep getting higher. The line drawn between the swing lows is ascending, while the resistance line is flat, causing what is called an Ascending triangle. Basically, the longers keep buying stock to raise the price, while the shorters sell stock to bring down. The fact that the price gets closer and closer to the resistance implayes that the buyers are dominating the game. If the price breaks above the resistance price, then the shorters know they lost, and in panic they will buy shares to avoid losing in their shorts, causing the price to go up. Figure 4.14: Triangle Here is a real example: Figure 4.15: Ascending triangle Descending triangle The observation here is that there is a hard support level, and the swingn highs keep getting lower. Basically, the shorters are on the attack selling stock (overflowing the market is supply)which causes the price to go down. The longers respond by buying stocks rasing the price. However, the fact that the buwing is not large enough cuases the swign high to appear lower and lower. If the price breaks below the support level, the longers know they lost, and wouldhave to sell to avoid lossing money. This will cuase the price to break lower. Figure 4.16: Descending triangle Symmetrical triangles The observation here is that for each swing high there is an equal swing low. The fact that the price difference between the highs and lows gets smaller means that longers and shorters are fighting equally strong. If the price breaks above the line joining the high swign, then the longers won, and the price will go up. If the price break below the line join the lower swings, then the shorters won. The longers panic to sell, causing price to go down.

If the broadening happens at the peak of a price, it is called broadening tops, and if the broadening happens while the prices are down, it is called a broadening bottom. When the current price surpasses the line set by the swing highs or lows, it indicates the likely direction of the price breakout. For instance, in the image below, the price of this stocks enters into a broadening pattern (check how the difference between swign high and lows broadens). The pattern is happening while prices are on the low part, so this is called a Broadening bottom, Now check, how by point 5, the price excess the swings highs. This marks the likely beginning of a bull trend, and it probably signals a good point to buy stock. Basically, the shorters realize they cannot win the war when the see that despite their efforts, the price moved up. They have to start buying stock to avoid losses. This increase in buying power increases the price. Figure 4.18: Broadening Bottom longers win Lets now check the pattern below. A broadening top, in which the shorters win.

The general look of the candle is a long single shadow and a small body (the candle looks like a hammer). Whether it occurs at the peak or bottom of a trend determines the name. Figure 5.21: The hammer In general, this candle reflects an anemic war. Basically, both teams fought hard during the time of this candle (as indicated by the length of one of the shadows). Unfortunately, the team to lose more is the one leading the prior trend. So commonly, this candle indicates a reverse in the price trend. Again, what this type of candle indicates is an anemic attack by both teams at the end of a long war. They tried, which explains the large variation in price during the time of the candle, but at the end, the price closes at a very similar price that it opened; and the consequence is a reversal in price.

It does not matter whether it is bull or bear candle, but it has to be at the end of a downward price trend. What the candle tell you is that there was a massive attempt by the bears to bring down the price (Evidence by the low shadow of the candle), but when closing the price when still up. Basically, the attacks during that time were not enough for the bears to win the battle decisively. The consequence of the anemic effort is for the longers to dominate and win. It is expected for the price to grow after a hammer candle. Figure 5.23: The hammer The Inverted hammer The hammer can also also be inverted and have the same effect. The price will go up.

Imagine that you want to go for a swim in a pool. Say your body temperature is rising (you have a fever); in this case, the temperature rise is an indicator telling you that probably going to the pool is not a good idea. Technical indicators are sort of the same; they provide hints upon whether investing in an stock is a good idea or not. Say there is no volume being traded in an stock with very new highs, while showing an overbought (high RSI), and there is no momentum up (e.g., very low to none Ehlers correlation), this probably tells you that buying is not a good idea. Fundamental indicators is another source of information used to improve the odds. In the case of the fever analogy, fundamental indicators, are like funidng out why you got sick. There are numerous fundamental indicators that provide hints into the health of a company. This is the strategy of Warrent Buffet, which is to study companies that are undervalue (e.g., low RSI) but are solid (e.g., to big to fail, like APLE, Facebook, etc.). Lets check over some Fundamental indicators: "],["earning-per-share-ratio-eps.html", "Earning per Share ratio (EPS)", " Earning per Share ratio (EPS) EPS is simply the earnings (e.g., profits) of a company divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. Say a company makes $100 in profits and has 100 shares. Here the EPS of this company is $1. You could look over time to EPS to see how well a company is doing, or you can compare among companies in the same sector, to see if by comparison the company is doing better or worse. Figure 6.1: EPS The index could be more precise by adding any diluted shares or preferred dividents [e.g., basically agreements the company has that could be turned into shares (e.g., a debt that can be paid with shares)] leading to: Figure 6.2: EPS The overall expectation is that if EPS within a company increases, or is higher than other companies in the same sector, the stock price will increase. One would expect traders will be willing to pay more for such a good company. That conclusion is not bullet proof, price may go up in low or lowers EPS, if on the eyes of analysts, EPS should have been even worse. "],["price-to-earning-pe.html", "Price to Earning (P/E)", " Price to Earning (P/E) You can extent the use of the EPS to adjust by the price of the shares. Figure 6.3: P/E ratio This metric is interpreted a couple ways: how much money you have to pay in stocks with this company to get $1; or how many years you have to wait to get your money back with this company. A high P/E could mean that a stocks price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. A low P/E can indicate either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. Lets consider two companies: AIs Ice cream (A): Stock Price = $18 Diluted EPS = $2 P/E = 9x ($18 ÷ $2) Bobs frozen snacks (B): Stock Price = $18 Diluted EPS = $6 P/E = 3x ($18 ÷ $6) Figure 6.4: P/E ratio In this example, in company A you pay $9 for $1 of earnings, while in company B you pay $3 for $1 of earnings. Basically, you can get three times as much in returns by investing in company B. Forward Price-To-Earnings is a variant of the P/E index, which uses best guess estimations of future earnings of the company. You could also see the trailing P/E or TTM, which is the P/E ratio in the last 12 months. "],["price-to-earning-growth-ratio-peg.html", "Price to Earning Growth ratio (PEG)", " Price to Earning Growth ratio (PEG) A variation on the P/E ratio is the price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio, or PEG. The PEG ratio is calculated as a companys price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. Figure 6.5: PEG ratio PEG ratios can be termed trailing if using historic growth rates or forward if using projected growth rates. A low P/E ratio may suggest that a stock is undervalued and therefore should be bought  but factoring in the companys growth rate to get its PEG ratio can tell a different story. If there is not growth in earnings, it would not be as good as if there is positive and significant growth. One could be more confident buying an undervalued stock (low P/E) with large growth (Low PEG). Lets consider an example: Company A Price per share = $46 EPS this year = $2.09 EPS last year = $1.74 P/E ratio = $46 / $2.09 = 22 Earnings growth rate = ($2.09 / $1.74) - 1 = 20% PEG ratio = 22 / 20 = 1.1 Company B Price per share = $80 EPS this year = $2.67 EPS last year = $1.78 P/E ratio = $80 / $2.67 = 30 Earnings growth rate = ($2.67 / $1.78) - 1 = 50% PEG ratio = 30 / 50 = 0.6 The lower P/E ratio could make company A look more attractive (one could get more return for less money invested). But compared to Company B, it doesnt have a high enough growth rate to justify its P/E. Company B is trading at a discount to its growth rate and investors purchasing it are paying less per unit of earnings growth. Figure 6.6: Low PEG is better As a broad rule of thumb, some investors feel that a PEG ratio below one is desirable. PEG values smaller than one suggest that the price of the stock is low compare to the anticipated growth (i.e., a good hint to buy).

If you were to sell everything that would be the total value of the assets of company A. Say is it $300. Say, this company, also, has a /$100 in debt. The book value of company A then, would be Assets ($300) - liabilities ($100)= $200. Book value could be compared to companys market value to indicate whether a stock is under- or overpriced. Market value or market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current share price Book value is used in other indicators. Book value per share (BVPS) Should a company be dissolve, the book value per common share (BVPS) indicates the dollar value remaining for shareholders after all assets are liquidated and all debtors are paid. BVPS is calculated as: Figure 6.8: Book value per share If a companys BVPS is higher than its market value per share, then its stock may be considered to be undervalued. Price-To-Book (P/B Ratio) Also refereed as price-equity ratio, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) compares a firms market capitalization to its book value. Its calculated by dividing the companys stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS): Figure 6.9: Price-To-Book ratio Say you want to invest in Eds company with the following profile: Book value =$1,000,000 Outstanding shares= 100,000 Stock price = $20 From this, Book value per share= $1,000,000/100,000 shares= $10. This tells you that if the company were to be close each owner of one share would get $10. P/B Ratio = $20 (Stock price) / $10 (Book value per share)= 2x This tell you Eds stock cost twice as much as its assets could be sold for. A larger than 1 P/B value suggest that investors value this company a lot; likely is is expected to growth more and be more valuable in the near future. If stocks prices trade lower than their book value (e.g., P/B value smaller than one) indicates that investors consider the stated value assets of the company to be exaggerated.

An IV thats lower than HV could suggest that IV is understating the stocks potential price change. An IV thats higher than HV could suggest the opposite. Further, a low IV percentile could indicate that options premiums are relatively low, and there might be opportunities to go long. IV can also be used to define the bounds of profit takes.

OBV can also be used as signals of trend reversals. OBV divergence Rising OBV during a trading range indicates accumulation, which is bullish. If OBV is trending higher, while price is going down, expect for price to reverse.

On days of increasing volume, you can expect prices to increase, and on days of decreasing volume, you can expect prices to decrease. This goes with the idea of the market being in-gear and out-of-gear. Both PVI and NVI work in similar fashions: Both are a running cumulative of values, which means you either keep adding or subtracting price rate of change each day to the previous days sum.

A PFE value that fluctuates around the zero line could indicate that the supply and demand for the security are in balance and the price may trade sideways.

Logically speaking, any movement outside of these bounds suggests the movement is not inherently random in nature.

The custom smoothing functions are very similar to Exponential Moving Averages, but, instead of adding one to the time period setting to create the smoothing multiplier (as in a true EMA), the smoothing functions just use the period by itself. The PMO oscillates in relation to a zero line. Normally, the PMO direction indicates if strength is increasing or decreasing, while the steepness of the trend angle demonstrates the power behind the move. Since this is an internal ratio calculation (versus external, like the standard relative strength calculation, which divides one price by another price index), it returns a result that is normalized and can be compared to the PMO result of any other security or index. Therefore, chartists can rank a list of securities or indexes in relative strength order simply by using their PMO values. The list does not have to be homogeneous; the PMO can be used to rank market indexes, stocks and mutual funds in the same list. The PMO also gives hints of important direction changes by forming divergences against the price index.

Exits should be taken when price hits the last four weeks bottom. See image below. The problem of the raw rule is that by exiting at the bottom of the last four weeks, there are not as much gains, as if to exit earlier. As such, it is recommended to look for alternative points of exit. Figure 14.10: Four week rule 52 weeks high lows When a stock gets closer to the highest or lowest price of the past 52 weeks, large volatility is expected. If it gets closer to the highest 52week price, it is likely because of strong fundamentals and/or positive news, which may then allow the stock to keep moving up. It has also been suggested that acquisitions are likely to move forward for the stock company near its 52w high. Altogether prices may continue to go up (Arrow B in the plot below). The other possibility at the 52week high, is that long positions get closed to secure profits; and the massive sell off can trigger a price reduction (Arrow A in the plow below). Differentiating between these alternative options can be done with the use of candles. For instance, if price surpasses the 52week high, but at the end of day closes below it, it should happen with a shooting start candle (Price was force high but did not succeed). Figure 14.11: Relative to 52 Weeks HighLow Similar volatility can be expected when a stock reaches its lowest price in the last 52Weeks. Price near the low 52w can force traders to close short positions (that is likely as low as price will get); in turn massive buying can trigger price increase (Arrow A). The opposite is also likely, when the price continue to go down (Arrow B). Perhaps a hammer candle should can help differentiate between these alternatives. Figure 14.12: Relative to 52 Weeks HighLow One study showed that when an entire sector nears its 52-week high, individual stocks within that sector are likely to see excess gains that are higher than stocks that breach 52-week highs in a mixed or downtrodden sector.

Basically, there is some pressure in the uptrend (as noted with the larger wicks), which is not effective at maintaining the trend (which is indicated by the closing getting closer to the opening, that is the candles start having smaller bodies).
