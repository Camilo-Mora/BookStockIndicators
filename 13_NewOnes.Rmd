Indicators below may be grouped into the categories above, but were found after the original list was compiled.

## 139 Polarized Fractal Efficiency {-}
Polarized Fractal Efficiency's signature characteristic is its use of fractal geometry in determining how efficiently a security's price is moving.  It determines the strength and direction of the trend.


```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Polarized Fractal Efficiency'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/PFEf.png")
```

The Polarized Fractal Efficiency (PFE) indicator measures the strength of the trend by its position relative to the zero line. As a general rule, the further the PFE value is away from zero, the stronger and more efficient the given trend is. A PFE value that fluctuates around the zero line could indicate that the supply and demand for the security are in balance and the price may trade sideways. 

A reversal in the direction of the PFE indicator and its movement away from zero is generally considered a buy signal.


```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Polarized Fractal Efficiency'}

```

## 140 Random Walk Index {-}
RWI compares a security's price movements to random movements in an effort to determine if it's in a statistically significant trend.

The bounds of randomness, also known as displacement distances, could be calculated by taking the square foot of the number of binary events, which refer to two-sided outcomes with equal probability (like a coin toss). Logically speaking, any movement outside of these bounds suggests the movement is not inherently random in nature. The RWI applies these mathematical principles when measuring an uptrend and downtrend to determine if it's random or statistically meaningful. 

The index delivers two ouputs for the high and low trading prices.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Random Walk Index High'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RWh.png")
```

the Low index is similar:

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Random Walk Index Low'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RWl.png")
```

Readings above 1.0 indicate that a security is trending higher or lower, while readings below 1.0 suggest that a security may be moving randomly. The two lines can be substracted to create a single indicator, that appears to capture the signals from the two lines:
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Random Walk Index'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RW.png")
```


Oftentimes, traders and market timers will enter long positions when a long-term RWI High is greater than 1.0 and the short-term RWI Low is also above 1.0. This means the trader tracks two RWI calculations, a longer-term one, say 64-periods, and a short-term one, say seven-periods. 

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Random Walk Index at two lengths'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RW2.png")
```

## 141 Demarker (DeM) {-}

DeM compares the most recent maximum and minimum prices to the previous period's equivalent price to measure the demand of the underlying asset. From this comparison, it aims to assess the directional trend of the market. 

It helps identify entry or exit points by capitalizing on probable imminent price trends ( it is a “leading” indicator because it signals an imminent change in price trend).

In contrast to  Relative Strength Index, which focuses on the close price, DEM focus on maximumn and minum prices. It could benefr from an EMA (Ornage line, below) to remove short-term variability.


```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Demarker'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Demarker.png")
```


## 142 Decision Point {-}
The DecisionPoint Price Momentum Oscillator is derived by taking a 1-period rate of change and smoothing it with two custom smoothing functions. The custom smoothing functions are very similar to Exponential Moving Averages, but, instead of adding one to the time period setting to create the smoothing multiplier (as in a true EMA), the smoothing functions just use the period by itself. 

The PMO oscillates in relation to a zero line. Normally, the PMO direction indicates if strength is increasing or decreasing, while the steepness of the trend angle demonstrates the power behind the move. Since this is an internal ratio calculation (versus external, like the standard relative strength calculation, which divides one price by another price index), it returns a result that is normalized and can be compared to the PMO result of any other security or index. Therefore, chartists can rank a list of securities or indexes in relative strength order simply by using their PMO values. The list does not have to be homogeneous; the PMO can be used to rank market indexes, stocks and mutual funds in the same list. 

The PMO also gives hints of important direction changes by forming divergences against the price index. The most reliable signals are generated when the PMO is near the extremes of its normal range, or when a direction change and crossover occurs following a strong, clean, straight PMO move

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Decision Point'}

```

## 143 B3 directional {-}
Calculation similar to DeMarker, but it adds several smoothing, and an standardization by ATR.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'B3 directional'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/B3D.png")
```

## 144 Relative to past Week's High Low {-}

At least two strategies can be identified for using current price to prior weeks high and lows:

### Donchians weekly rule {-}
Donchian suggested that markets move on 4 weeks cycles, such that when a stock ranks at the top of the last 4 weeks, it will result in a price momentum, marking a good entry point for long trades. Exits should be taken when price hits the last four weeks bottom. See image below.

The problem of the raw rule is that by exiting at the bottom of the last four weeks, there are not as much gains, as if to exit earlier. As such, it is recommended to look for alternative points of exit.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Four week rule'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Four week rule.png")
```

### 52 weeks high lows {-}
When a stock gets closer to the highest or lowest price of the past 52 weeks, large volatility is expected.

If it gets closer to the highest 52week price, it is likely because of strong fundamentals and/or positive news, which may then allow the stock to keep moving up. It has also been suggested that acquisitions are likely to move forward for the stock company near its 52w high. Altogether prices may continue to go up (Arrow B in the plot below).

The other possibility at the 52week high, is that long positions get closed to secure profits; and the massive sell off can trigger a price reduction (Arrow A in the plow below).

Differentiating between these alternative options can be done with the use of candles. For instance, if price surpasses the 52week high, but at the end of day closes below it, it should happen with a shooting start candle (Price was force high but did not succeed).


```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Relative to 52 Weeks HighLow'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/52WR.png")
```

Similar volatility can be expected when a stock reaches its lowest price in the last 52Weeks. Price near the low 52w can force traders to close short positions (that is likely as low as price will get); in turn massive buying can trigger price increase (Arrow A). The opposite is also likely, when the price continue to go down (Arrow B). Perhaps a hammer candle should can help differentiate between these alternatives.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Relative to 52 Weeks HighLow'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/52WRLow.png")
```
One study showed that when an entire sector nears its 52-week high, individual stocks within that sector are likely to see excess gains that are higher than stocks that breach 52-week highs in a mixed or downtrodden sector.

## 145 Removal from or addition to SP500 {-}
The addition or removal of a stocks from the SP500, and perhaps other indicators based on high standards for inclusion, can have strong effects of stock price. The idea here is to short stocks that are removed and buy stocks that are added.

In 2021, the S&P announced additions and removals in December 3 and changes became effective on the closing of December 17th.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'SP500 removed or added'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SP500Removal.png")
```

The figure below show the price for one of the stocks added. As noted changes were obvious after the 17th.
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'SP500 added'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SP500Addition.png")
```


The figure below show the price for one of the stocks removed As noted changes were obvious on the 17th. Although price eventually recovered to that position several days later.
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'SP500 removed'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SP500Removed.png")
```

## 146 Hedge Fund copycat {-}
Hedge Funds are organizations, where people can place their money to be invested at the discretion of the experts working the given Hedge Fund. Some of these organizations have access to lots of money to acquire data available, have the best information and manpower to take advantage of inefficiencies in the markets, or make wise (sane) long term investments.

By law, every three months, they have to release the list of stocks they have invested on. Using this list as reference for investment have shown considerably high profits that investing in the S&P500 alone.

## 147 Momentum in weekly winners and lossers {-}
Several studies have indicated that after a given stock ranks at the top or bottom of all stocks weekly (winners and losers), results in predicable patterns of price change during the following weeks.
